# Weather Dashboard

## Descripton
- This project is a weather dashboard that lets you type in any city and retrieve the current weather forecast, as well as a five day forecast. 
- When you search a city, your search will be saved the next time you click on the search bar, and will be displayed in a list format below the search bar.
- The current weather for that city will be displayed on the screen, as well as a five day forecast for that city below it. 

## Usage 
- To use the application, simply click on the deployed link below and search any city you'd like, and the weather will pop up immediately.
